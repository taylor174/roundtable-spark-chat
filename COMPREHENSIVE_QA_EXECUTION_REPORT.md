## Known Issues & Recommendations

### Security Linter Findings
1. **Security Definer View Warning** (Low Priority)
   - Issue: `tables_safe` view uses SECURITY DEFINER
   - Status: Acceptable for this use case
   - Action: Monitor for potential privilege escalation

2. **OTP Expiry Warning** (Low Priority)
   - Issue: OTP expiry exceeds recommended threshold
   - Impact: Authentication timeout is longer than best practice
   - Action: Consider reducing OTP expiry time

### Performance Optimizations
- ✅ **Database Indexing:** Properly configured
- ✅ **Query Optimization:** Efficient queries implemented
- ✅ **Caching Strategy:** Client-side caching in place
- ⚠️ **CDN Integration:** Could enhance global performance
